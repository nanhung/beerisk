## Automatically create fitted function

  ylab("Mortality rate")+xlab(bquote('Dose ('*mu*g~L^-1*')'))
p33<-p3 + stat_smooth(method=lm, formula = y ~ sin(2 * pi * (x - 1)/365) + cos(2 * pi * (x - 1)/365), color="red") + geom_point()+
  ylab("Rate ratio")+xlab("Time (day)")

##Use grid.arrange(), from the gridExtra package
grid.arrange(p11, p22,p33, ncol=1)
